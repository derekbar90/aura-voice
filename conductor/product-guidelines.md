# Product Guidelines

## Brand Voice & Prose Style
- **Helpful & Approachable:** We use warm, encouraging language to guide users through advanced AI tasks like voice cloning, making the technology feel accessible rather than intimidating.
- **Minimalist & Direct:** Our instructions are concise and efficient, respecting the user's time and aligning with the compact nature of a menubar utility.
- **Transparent:** We are clear about the local nature of the processing, reinforcing the privacy benefits of the application.

## Design & Visual Identity
- **Native macOS Aesthetic:** The UI should feel like a first-class citizen of the macOS ecosystem, utilizing system fonts, standard spacing, and a clean, translucent menubar look.
- **Utility-Focused:** Every element should serve a functional purpose. We avoid unnecessary decorative elements that clutter the compact interface.
- **Clear Feedback:** Synthesis and cloning operations must provide immediate, clear visual progress indicators so the user is never left wondering about the system's state.

## User Experience Principles
- **Speed to Value:** Users should be able to go from text selection to audio output in as few clicks as possible.
- **Privacy by Default:** All processing is strictly local. The UI should subtly reinforce this through its design and messaging.
- **Fail Gracefully:** If an operation fails (e.g., poor quality recording for cloning), we provide constructive, easy-to-understand feedback on how to improve the result.
