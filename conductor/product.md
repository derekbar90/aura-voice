# Product Definition

## Initial Concept
A local-first, high-performance Text-to-Speech (TTS) application for macOS, utilizing the Qwen3-TTS model via MLX. It features an Electron-based menubar interface for seamless system-wide interaction, prioritizing privacy and offline capability.

## Target Users
- **Power Users:** Individuals who need a quick, reliable way to synthesize text directly from their menubar without context-switching.
- **Content Creators:** Creators who require high-quality, offline voice synthesis for their projects.
- **Privacy-Conscious Users:** Users who prefer local processing over cloud-based TTS services.

## Primary Goals
- Provide a seamless, local-first TTS experience integrated into the macOS menubar.
- Enable high-quality voice cloning and synthesis entirely offline using Apple Silicon optimization.
- Offer a professional, utility-focused interface for managing voices and controlling synthesis parameters.

## Core Features
- **Menubar Integration:** Real-time text-to-speech accessible via a system-wide menubar icon.
- **Local Voice Cloning:** Ability to create custom voice clones from audio recordings or files without internet access.
- **Voice Management:** A clean UI to manage, preview, and delete custom-cloned voices.
- **Interactive Synthesis:** Real-time control over speed, pitch, and style instructions for synthesis.
- **High Performance:** Optimized for Apple Silicon using the MLX framework for rapid inference.

## Design Philosophy
- **Professional & Clean:** A utility-first interface that prioritizes function and clarity.
- **Native Aesthetic:** Designed to blend naturally with the macOS desktop environment.
- **Interactive Feedback:** Providing visual cues during synthesis and voice cloning processes.
